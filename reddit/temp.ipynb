Harden opting out and taking less opens up a path for the 76ers to make legitimate upgrades for their roster for the upcoming season, beginning Thursday night when [the free-agency period opens](https://theathletic.com/live-blogs/nba-free-agency-news/14mq9CvrLUdl/). > >Lowering Harden's salary from $47.4 million allows 76ers president Daryl Morey to offer free agents the $10.5 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception without any other moves, flexibility Morey would have had difficulty creating by trading players already on guaranteed contracts. > >The 76ers acquired Harden in a blockbuster trade deadline deal with the [Brooklyn Nets](https://theathletic.com/team/nets/) and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals before a series loss to the [Miami Heat](https://theathletic.com/team/heat/). Harden’s co-star, MVP candidate [Joel Embiid](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/sixers/joel-embiid/), missed the first two games of the 76ers’ defeat to the Heat in six games. Harden, 32, is coming off his 10th All-Star team in 13 seasons, averaging 22 points, 10.3 assists and 7.7 rebounds per game in the 2021-22 campaign. > >In 12 playoff games, Harden’s averages dipped to 18.6 points, 8.6 assists and 5.7 rebounds. Across the 76ers and Harden’s camp, there’s been tremendous belief around the seven-time All-NBA star having a complete and healthy offseason this summer ahead of the 2022-23 season. In the 2020 offseason, the [NBA](https://theathletic.com/nba/) had a shortened summer due to the bubble season. Last year, Harden was recovering from a Grade 2 hamstring injury that he played through during Brooklyn's seven-game series against [Milwaukee](https://theathletic.com/team/bucks/) in the second round. > >Multiple sources said Harden returned to his workout and on-court regimen much sooner than usual this offseason, and has been ramping up his conditioning and training as the summer progresses. Typically, NBA players take time off before entering their offseason schedule, but Harden returned to his training just two weeks after the season ended on May 12. 76ers assistant Sam Cassell has spent extensive time running Harden’s regimen this summer, sources said.

      "{'title': \"US Open 3rd Round Men's Singles\", 'content': \"The second round was a good spot for a lot of guys who pulled upsets to prove that they were legit contenders. The third round is where a lot of the unexpected names start to disappear but you can guarantee there will be at least one crazy result that will make me look like a potatobrained muffin. I regret not doing the WTA matchups here but I was a bit exhausted after typing up the men's. Next year I will include both the men's and women's cuz ladies is pimps too. See below for more tennis : Djokovic Kudla : Kudla’s 3rd round appearance is seemingly out of nowhere, and after stealing two late breaks in the opening two sets it looked like Lajovic just didn’t have the fight left in him. Kudla’s reward will be a primetime matchup with Novak Djokovic, who had to work but didn’t allow Londero’s aggressive game to steal any momentum. Kudla really needed this result to salvage a poor season, but his tournament is over here. Novak is on his way to some very juicy matchups against Wawrinka and Medvedev and this will be his last simple match. Djokovic in 3. Wawrinka Lorenzi : Ugh. If you’re annoyed that I said Kecmanovic would roll Lorenzi take solace in the dollars I lost agreeing with myself. Throughout it just seemed like Kecmanovic would at some point take off and take control of the match but they juuuuuust keeeeeeept hoooolding seeeeeerve and Lorenzi played the big points better. The performance against Svajda is a big question mark now for me as he seemed to hit the ball significantly harder against Kecmanovic and looked back to the form that he had against Vesely. No rest for the wicked though, and he’ll have to put his sort of backwards sort of sideways hat back on quickly for a match with Wawrinka, who cleared the Chardy hurdle rather quickly. Stan is serving ok, keeping the ball in the court, and moving well for one of the first times since his return. This is a great sign for his upcoming test against Novak, and if Lorenzi pulls this upset it’s time for me to completely rethink how much the size of ones eyeballs affects ones tennis results. Wawrinka in 3 and Kecmanovic on a plane home shaking his head. Koepfer Basilashvili : Opelka has to be kicking himself right now. Koepfer returned probably the highest % of Opelka’s serves of anyone under 6’ who’s playing him. Whether he has a read on the serve or Opelka simply put the ball where he happened to be he’s through quickly to the first third round of his young career. This with the nice result at Wimbledon will give him some breathing room until next year because he’s earned his way onto the tour. Up next is a winnable but not winnable match against Basilashvili. Basilashvili wore down the plucky young American Brooksby, who fought but was a bit outclassed in the ballstriking department. Koepfer’s offense and aggressive baselining do give him a chance and Basilashvili is by no means a lockdown defender, but he does move well enough to return significantly better than Opelka and he hits big enough to give Koepfer’s backhand trouble. Still Koepfer has shown the ability to compete against this middle level of the tour so it could be conceivable he wins a set or two. Basilashvili in 5. Lopez Medvedev : Lopez gave Nishioka the same business he gave Fritz. He’s in great form and it all starts with the serve. Medvedev did the work against Dellien and seeing the close result will make Kwon feel a bit better about having to work so hard against Dellien that he got injured. Medvedev would be primed to play Nishioka after playing a baseliner in good form, but Lopez is a guy it’s hard to prepare for. Medvedev’s extra reach and composed nature are key here as sticking to your game while playing an opponent with a dangerous offense is difficult to do at times and the “find their backhand” “hang in there for errors” strategy just hasn’t worked so far against Lopez. Medvedev has to be feeling some physical fatigue from his match with Dellien and although the hangover from making a finals and winning an event hasn’t really appeared, I do worry. Still it’s hard to think that he isn’t favored here, and at this point in Lopez’ run I’m no longer betting on him but still not against him. Medvedev in 4-5 and I expect some tiebreakers. Federer Evans : I want to preface this by saying that this happens to me once every event. I watch Fed play. I see errors. I see complacency. I see backhand difficulties. I see a negative attitude on the court at times. I do it. I click his opponents name. I type in the dollar amount. I click the button. Boom. My money is gone, vanished into the abyss, and although losing money to the super predatory gambling industry is my least favorite I cannot help it. I am going to predict a Federer loss. Simply put, Federer is the most confusing champion to watch play in early rounds. He always looks like he’s struggling to find his backhand, and in-form opponents always seem like they could potentially snag him. Evans has shown that he is willing to compete against high level players and took a set from Nadal already this season. Evans possesses 2nd tier weapons but he possesses them all. He can produce any shot and fights for every point. I didn’t like what I saw from Federer against Dzumhur, and his loss to Rublev wasn’t as bad of a result as his movement during the match was almost lazy. If you’re a Federer fan you’re upset by now, but this is how I have to view things in order to consider that Evans may take him by surprise. This would be the win of Evan’s career, but this is also the best he’s ever played and Federer hasn’t hit that second gear yet. Evans in 4 (Federer will now win in 3). Carreno Busta Goffin : Two of the ATP’s best defensive baseliners going at it with both in solid form isn’t something I’d purport to be able to predict. Instead I will provide a list of things that each player looks like. Goffin looks like a preying mantis and pencil had a kid. PCB, same. Goffin looks like a Mexican elf got benjamin button disease. PCB looks like an iguana that joined the swim team and got chlorine in his eyes. If I’m being honest I’m reaching for content here. I don’t care about this match, but it’s going to be great. Who’s playing better? Well, Goffin seems to have way better results this year, but PCB is getting better each match and isn’t likely to give up, so given Goffin’s difficult holding holding serve I expect this one to have a great deal of breaks and I’m leaning towards Goffin but not enough to call it. Over/under on number of times PCB blinks during this match? Trick question he has never blinked and in fact only reverse blinks by opening his eyes slightly wider. Someone in 5. Dimitrov Majchrzak : This matchup is interesting because were it to occur a few weeks ago, there’s an argument that the young qualifier has been in better form. Dimitrov has been struggling for a while now, and whatever confidence issues him and Cilic are going through don’t seem to be solving themselves. At the same time the tour’s overall level is improving, and the window for both guys to win majors is going to be closing in the next 2-3 years as the next gen guys who are already notching big wins begin to notch those big wins more regularly against the big 3. Try reeling in a guy like Khachanov after he beats Djokovic. Try competing with Thiem for a title after he eliminates Nadal. The belief is going to be too strong and the “is my time over” is going to creep right in to Dimitrov’s head. Fortunately, Majchrzak is a few years away from really competing for titles, but he certainly has a good tennis IQ, a great serve, and an extra solid backhand. The bright points here for Dimitrov are that he’ll be the much fresher player with Majchrzak having come through qualifying and having finished off a downhill 5th set against Cuevas. There’s a tendency for up-and-coming players to have a letdown after an emotional win like that, and while Dimitrov has been the epitome of bunz this season, he has to win this one. Actually. While the “too much pressure and expectations” mark has been placed on Grigor, his results for 3+ years now have included a number of disappointing results and slumps, and there is only so long you can hang in that balance before people begin to consider your level your level. Dimitrov in 4 or Dimitrov losing this match for the next 5 years. Also Kamil I apologize, you did solve the Cuevas puzzle. De Minaur Nishikori : Popcooooooorn. If you had to pick two guys on tour who are going to bring the intensity and who lack the weapons to hit each other right off the court you are going to wind up with these two. Nishikori’s backhand is a nightmare for opponents to hit into, so much so that announcers criticize his forehand. Nishikori’s forehand is solid enough, and he shapes the ball well. He suffers on his serve, and that’s just fine because his returning will certainly give De Minaur equal troubles. De Minaur beat Garin who didn’t bring a high level in his match against Eubanks, so there’s nothing yet to really call the upset here in terms of results, but De Minaur’s aggression and speed may enable him to be there at the end of the match with opportunities. Nishikori dismissed Bradley Klahn who isn’t a household name yet but served well and crushed his forehand in this event, and Kei has a tendency to really show up for majors. If De Minaur wants to begin the next stage of his ascent on tour, this is the spot, and if he does, it’ll be well earned. De Minaur in 5. Rublev Kyrgios : We did it! Thank you Simon and a speedy recovery. Kyrgios continued his solid play against Hoang and that’s a great sign as he heads into a matchup with arguably the hottest player on tour right now. Of course Medvedev is the hottest quality player, but I promised in my last post I’d say something nice about Rublev so here go some compliments about his appearance. Let’s talk hotness. If I saw Rublev in the forest, I definitely wouldn’t think that a pollyo string cheese was wearing a wig and was angry at me, cuz he’s hot. Let’s talk romance. Rublev looks like he would definitely light candles for a first date, and also possibly use those candles to set your car on fire after a bad breakup, romantically. Let’s talk size. Rublev was voted most likely to be tall enough to satisfy girls profile requirements on tinder. Now, I’m a turtle so I’m not the best judge, but if I were looking to travel the world, it does look like Rublev could probably throw me pretty far. And that’s something. That’s definitely something. Let’s talk skincare. You may have noticed that Rublev plays outdoor tennis for a living, but is pale. A) Ghosts are sexy, how dare you. B) The man clearly wears sunscreen and lovin ain’t just for today. In 40 years his skin will be in good condition, save all the clawmarks from girls tryna get at him after his concerts. In all seriousness, his rise on tour is awesome and swift, and although he’s in a boy band and it’s impossible to take him seriously, he has a legit chance to unseat a lot of the next gen guys as the “next in line” player on hardcourt. On the other side of the net is Nick Kyrgios, who you probably haven’t heard of. This is due to the conspiracy of the ATPminati. Kyrgios is still playing hard and has had minimal blowups, so I am hard pressed to criticize him here. I think that if people want him to leave behind his garbage attitude and self-centered behavior, they have to stop asking him about it the moment he stops engaging in it. Steve Johnson righted the ship and we should enjoy the quality tennis while we can, because it is so disappointing watching him give up in winnable matches. Given Rublev’s win over Tsitsipas and Federer he’s definitely a slight favorite in this match, but Kyrgios’ serve is just world’s better than Rublev’s. Where Nick throws in double faults by being overly aggressive, Rublev struggles to find his second serve at times. In the rallies I’d give a slight edge to Rublev because although Nick can smoke the ball, he struggles to do so when his opponent is hitting with power. The flat backhand is a solid tool, but Rublev drives his. I think we’ll see this match go deep and although I don’t want to say it, these are two guys whose only problem is not being able to take a loss. Over/under on racquets smashed is 4. Rublev will be yelling at his box. Nick will be yelling at his collection of cancelled extras from The Muppets Go Hipster. The player who wins this one likely will be the one who stays more composed. The ghost of cauliflower in 5. Berretini Popyrin : HE’S BACK YOU GUYS! Everyone’s favorite yellow racquet is back on tour. Thompson gave it his all and you have to admire the way he’s fought his way onto the tour, but Berretini’s offense was able to push through in the big moments and that sets up a clash with Popyrin, who seems destined for great levels as his young career continues to trend upwards. Kukushkin isn’t exactly a dominant player on tour, but he gives very little away and beating him following a first set loss is a great sign for Popyrin’s maturity. These two play very similar styles but produce their shots in different ways. This would be a great match to watch from court level as there will be some 100+ mph winners off the forehand wings and some great aggressive play. Slight edge to Berretini because of his experience and his forehand will be the biggest weapon on the court as it usually is. Berretini in 4-5. Monfils Shapovalov.: This is a frustrating matchup to predict so I will predict it both ways to illustrate that point. Monfils tends to get a bit defensive and hang behind the baseline. He has a tendency to go for bailout dropshots at times that seem really motivated only by showmanship and the “i can beat you” factor. Shap’s problems are mainly errors when his opponents pressure him, and pressure in his service games causes his first serve to go, and he throws in doubles. Against a more passive opponent who is content to retrieve, Shap is going to be able to work the points and get his forehand on more balls than usual. With control of a rally it is difficult to stop Shap, and he does move to the net with enough frequency that Monfils getting out of position is a losing proposition. Shap in 4-5. Monfils has the physical ability to stifle Shap’s initial offense, and can hit with enough power and length when motivated to keep Shap from hitting outright winners. This will spell errors, and while Shap’s serve can be excellent, Monfils can breeze through service games in his own right and doesn’t really have issues with double faulting like Shap does. It’ll be hard to Shap to not get caught up in the oneupmanship battle against Monfils and I don’t see too many players beating him at this simply because athletic ability is really what gives players the edge in intangible rallies and Monfils is the best athletic talent on tour. Monfils in 4-5. Most Monfils matches are this way. The match rests entirely on his racquet and when he loses, it looks like he wanted to. When he wins, you wonder why he doesn’t have a major to his name. Which Monfils will show up? Andujar Bublik : “The computer man has written about you again” Andujar stirs from his trance. His match with Sonego finished only 8 hours ago but he has been meditating for 15. “A man is man, nothing more,” he declares, and lumbers off in search of jaguars to wrestle with. Hardcourt specialist Pablo Andujar is back at it again, and I’m inclined to give up my senseless doubt and become a believer. The same will have to be said for Bublik, who snatched victory from 2 sets down against Fabbiano. Bublik seems to be profiting in a major way from getting to net, as I’ve watched opponent after opponent pass him for 2/3 of the match but struggle to find the gaps in the 5th set. I’ve gone on record before saying that Bublik’s T-serve looks like he could hit it 100 times in a row and no one would touch it, and that’s a big weapon to have in his arsenal against a guy who doesn’t rely solely on aces. I didn’t catch the Andujar Sonego match, and I don’t want to mislead you into thinking I know why he’s suddenly winning hardcourt matches. He has always played the same consistent game on hardcourt as he does on clay, where once he gets control of a rally he seems to have the ball on a string. At this point with wins over Jarry, Edmund, and a quick dismissal of Sonego make me think it’s time to stop doubting him. Bublik’s played two 5 setters in a row, and Andujar should be the fresher player. Having beaten Jarry and Sonego he’ll have had some good reps returning big serves, and his control should allow him to find the gaps in Bublik’s aggression where previous opponents have struggled. Andujar in 4. Zverev Bedene : Zverev and Tiafoe produced a great match, and the better player won. Bedene and Paire played 4 hours of tennis, and Bedene excised some demons and got his first hardcourt win against Paire. With that win Bedene has about 7 straight wins on hardcourt, and that gives him a chance against Zverev. Zverev has two winnable matches ahead of him to reach the quarters, and if his team can’t gameplan a way for him to turn this match into a backhand to backhand exchange, some people need to get fired. Bedene is an accurate journeyman with a swift forehand, and a decent serve. This is Zverev’s match to lose, and I’d love to say he “can’t” lose it, but he’s not there yet. Still, for a player who’s been slumping the slightest hint of a return to top levels can bring out the best game, and I expect Zverev to be the fresher player and eke out a victory here. Zverev in 4. Schwartzman Sandgren : Diego has really had a nice draw to this point, and can’t complain about this matchup. Sandgren did well to steal the match from Tsonga, and got a gift of a second round in Vasek Pospisil. I can’t help but look at Sandgren and think that he is carrying a tiny bit of weight, and while he hits a heavy ball on the forehand side Diego’s speed will be able to neutralize that. While Sandgren does have an excellent serve, Diego is usually one of the tour’s leaders in return games won. I’m not really telling you anything if I say Diego suffers on serve due to his height, and this game is a fairly simple equation. If Diego is able to move Sandgren he will win. If Sandgren’s serve is effective enough to get him deep into this match, he’ll win. Schwartzman in 4. Isner Cilic : Isner has been solid the first two rounds and a straight set win over Struff is scary good considering how poor his results have been this year. Cilic managed to avoid any major trauma in the Stebe match and played solid. I have to say given Isner’s form and Cilic’s struggles Isner is the favorite in this one. Cilic showed some guff today though by having a few buttons unbuttoned; he could be getting his groove back. Still the equation here is simple. Is Cilic going to step up a level? If so he has a shot since his reach gives him a better chance than most to return Isner’s serve. That step up in level hasn’t been seen in a while though, so it’s better not to expect it and be pleasantly surprised. Isner in 4. Chung Nadal : Our very own Chung has another 5 set comeback win. Some may say “chungofficial” isn’t really Hyeon Chung, but one of those people was me, and do you trust me? Look at how many tennis matches I have gotten wrong. I am clearly not to be trusted, and if you cannot trust a turtle, who can you trust? Chungofficial, that’s who. Nadal, who is still looking pretty solid to win the US Open, is a nightmare matchup for Chung. Chung’s backhand is great but Nadal’s forehand gets height on it that will exhaust that wing and Chung’s serve and forehand are not quite back to the form that saw his deep run at the AO (pls correct me if I’m wrong). Bright things are on the horizon for Chung as he continues to find his form but this is not the time or the place to be optimistic. Pick your butt, fix your hair.

      "{'title': 'First Time Apple Watch Owner... Here are my impressions of the Series 3 with LTE', 'content': '**Why did I get an Apple Watch?** My primary motivation for purchasing the Apple Watch was to join forces with my AirPods and deliver the best possible music listening experience while running outdoors and exercising at the gym. I spend roughly 10 hours each week either running outdoors or working out at the gym. I really enjoy my AirPods, but I don\\'t enjoy the lack of touch controls on the AirPods. Additionally, I don\\'t like the way my iPhone 6 Plus feels in my pocket as I run, and at the gym I often have to take my phone out of my pocket because various exercises cause my phone to fall out of my pocket. In addition to this, I liked the idea of being able to see all of my notifications (of which I receive many) without the need to constantly keep my phone in my pocket and pull it out when my pants vibrate. ---- **Has the watch lived up to expectations?** So far, yes, it has pretty much delivered on its promise. I really do find running even more of a joy now. It feels really nice to go for runs with nothing more than a house key in my pockets and a watch on my wrist (and no wires anywhere). Changing the volume as I run is easy with the digital crown. Holding the digital crown and telling Siri what to play is also super easy. It\\'s nice to be able to control the many hours worth of music I downloaded to my watch (and I already reached capacity haha) but it\\'s really crazy to think that I\\'ll be able to stream pretty much every song ever on my watch starting next month. As for getting notifications without having to take out my phone... It\\'s a nice little luxury, but since my phone is still usually with me anyway unless I\\'m working out, it\\'s only marginally useful. The main thing I like about it is just that I no longer feel obligated to keep my phone in my pocket at all times while I\\'m home. ---- **What else about the watch do I find useful?** I really *did not expect* that the watch face itself would be so useful. Granted, I gave an assist with some paid apps, but when I look down at my watch I see the following: https://i.imgur.com/7aqjhp5.jpg Top-Left: Calendar (Apple default). Center: Carrot Weather. Bottom-Left: Things. Bottom-Center: Fantastical. Botton-Right: Music What this little image doesn\\'t show you is that the \"Things\" complication has a meter showing what % of my daily to-dos I have completed, and the \"Fantastical\" complication shows the time of my next event. For someone who struggles with organization, it\\'s really nice being able to keep track of my events and to-dos at a quick glance (not to mention my upcoming reminders). And I am convinced that access to a detailed Carrot Weather report from just a glance at my watch is an unbeatable solution to getting the weather details I need to know for the rest of my day. Other highlights: - GPS / Apple Maps on the watch is much nicer to have on the watch than on the phone when it comes to walking around. - Fitness tracking is really nice to use while running. Sure, the iPhone can do this too, but I never felt motivated enough to constantly pull my phone out of my pocket and check my current time and distance. But the watch makes keeping track of health and fitness stats fun. - Going back to the whole thing with the music again... the Apple Watch + AirPods (or your Bluetooth headphones of choice) is useful for more than just exercising... if you listen to a lot of music during the day it\\'s a great thing to have in general. No wires to worry about while cooking, but with the ability to easily press stop if someone starts talking to you IRL. No other music listening experience beats the overall convenience of a nice pair of Blutooth headphones with the Apple Watch. ---- **Low Points** - When I first started using the Apple Watch, my notifications were completely busted and I was not too happy. I eventually figured out I should try unpairing and re-pairing the watch from my phone, a process that took ~25 minutes. This did fix my issues, but it caused a few hours of frustration. - I have found Siri inconsistent. At random times when I give Siri a command, she will tell me that she is not connected to the Internet... even though she clearly is. - Another Siri-related issue. When I\\'m in the same house with my phone and I tell Siri on my watch to play a song, she\\'ll change the song on the phone but *not* the watch. I don\\'t know if there\\'s a way to fix this. (This is not an issue when I take the watch away from my phone, like when I\\'m out for runs for example). I don\\'t know if this is just a huge design flaw or if there\\'s something wrong with my watch in particular, but it\\'s frustrating either way. - No podcasts app. Boo. ---- **To LTE or not to LTE... that is the question** Do I find the LTE useful? Yes, I do. During the couple of hours I spend working out every day, it\\'s nice to be able to *mostly* just concentrate on what I\\'m doing without getting too distracted (like I do with my phone often), but still being connected and around to respond to something if I need to. But I think the best thing about LTE won\\'t arrive until next month when you have basically any song you want available for playing on your wrist at any time. Considering that you also get double the storage on the LTE version (16 GB vs 8 GB), it was an easy decision for me to get the LTE version. The future resale value will probably completely make up for the $70 difference in upfront cost. As for the $10 per month charge... Well, you can always cancel it. But for the various reasons I have mentioned, I\\'m quite sure I will be keeping it (also worth mentioning that my carrier gives me the first 3 months for free). As for battery... It\\'s not perfect, but it gets the job done for me. I\\'ve been using the LTE connection for roughly ~1.5 hours each day, with the remainder of the time having the phone either paired with my phone or on WiFi. I also use it to listen to music during my commute. I\\'ve been getting home with low battery, but I\\'ve made it. So I haven\\'t suffered due to lack of battery... at least so far. Oh, and that red dot? It may seem bad in HD photos and 4k videos with extreme close-ups... but in the real world, no one cares. You don\\'t even see the dot when you wear the watch. Other people don\\'t really notice it either unless they\\'re looking for it. But if you just can\\'t get over it, then suck it up and pay $10 to buy some WatchDots and cover it up. ---- **Final Thoughts** Despite some of the issues I\\'ve had with Siri, I\\'m really happy with my watch. I feel that it\\'s already becoming an integral part of my daily existence. It really does make all my time running and at the gym more enjoyable for me. I enjoy the easier access to notifications, and I *really* enjoy all the useful information I have access to just from a quick glance at my watch. It\\'s a tool that makes me just a little bit more efficient and a bit more likely to be mindful of my schedule and tasks I need to accomplish. And getting the day\\'s weather forecast is now as easy as checking the time. But make no mistake, the Apple Watch is still ultimately second fiddle to your phone and there\\'s a lot it can\\'t do even with LTE. You *need* your phone if want to do more than the basic tasks of playing music and checking the time/weather/calendar/reminders/to-dos/phone calls/texts/emails/brief news headlines. So, who should get this watch? A few points: - I can only recommend the LTE version for people who exercise regularly and enjoy the idea of being able to workout without your phone in your pocket but still want some way of being connected to the world. - I\\'d recommend the non-LTE version for people who don\\'t care so much about the fitness stuff but like the idea of something that can boost their productivity a little bit by not having to pull their phone out of their pockets quite so often and getting distracted by it. - If you don\\'t have some real expendable income, then I wouldn\\'t recommend getting any Apple Watch. Ultimately nothing about the watch is essential like a phone or a computer. It\\'s just a very nice little luxury.', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/72vz3u/first_time_apple_watch_owner_here_are_my/', 'created_utc': '2017-09-27 22:48:57', 'subreddit': 'apple'}\n",

      "{'title': '[Dev] It’s official. QKSMS has been released!', 'content': \"[Dev] It’s official. QKSMS has been released! It has been a long time coming, but it’s finally happened. The first time I let anyone but close friends use the app, it was here on Reddit. Since then, I’ve seen a phenomenal response from the Android community and I have all of you to thank for that. The last few months have been the most influential period of my life, and QKSMS has completely changed my trajectory. I’m here to answer any comments/questions about the app or otherwise, so feel free to ask me anything! (Last time I replied to over 500 comments, today let’s beat that!) Anyway, for those who don’t know, QKSMS is a beautiful SMS app that brings to the table some gorgeous color schemes, an awesome QuickReply, night mode, and much more. Oh also, it’s never going to have ads. Just want to make that abundantly clear. [Here are some mouthwatering screenshots of the app](http://imgur.com/a/qR5Qt) [And here’s the Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS) To get things started, I’ll ask myself and answer a few questions that I’m sure will be asked :) --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] Hey Moez! When’s the next update coming out? [A] I just uploaded it an hour ago! It should be available to download shortly :) --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] This app looks pretty good. It also looks exactly Textra. What gives? [A] Thanks! The reason both apps look so similar is because their designs originate from the same place, the Material Design guidelines. Don’t take that as me just blaming the guidelines as an excuse for me to copy them though, QKSMS actually looked like this months before Textra did. [Here are some screenshots of QKSMS from June 29th.](https://plus.google.com/106460087505182599955/posts/AoL2e63u9RP) Note, you will need to be a part of the QKSMS Tester community for the post to be visible to you. --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] Hey! Aren’t you the asshole who started the witchhunt towards Textra saying that they copied you? [A] After Textra released their Material Design update, I did make a post talking about how I think that they copied my design. I’m sure you can understand how I felt when I open my phone and see that this major app now looks just like mine, but after I had some time to cool off and figure things out, I came out and apologized to their team about the whole debacle. I never meant for it to be a witchhunt, but [here’s the post that I made](https://plus.google.com/106460087505182599955/posts/KpNaKZa9oes) in case anyone’s curious. --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] Development really slowed down after you started school, how did it pick up again? Surely school doesn’t slow down. [A] There’s a few factors to this. The first; I uh, I dropped out. I was offered a full-time job just a few weeks in, and their offer was more than generous. It’s a great company with great people, as well as a great opportunity. I felt that taking the job was my best path to get where I want to go. I want to pursue Android development, and new I get to work with other talented developers on a major app that has millions of users. It’s an amazing learning experience, and I get to start my career 5 years early :) Now that I’m not on such a strict schedule with classes and exams, I get to spend a lot more time working on my own projects too. So I’ve been able to put more time into QK, but that’s not all. Recently I partnered with a very talented developer who’s been helping tremendously with getting QK closer to 100%. In a week, he fixed most of the bugs that I’ve been having for months, and I’m excited to see how far we can take it together. Shane (/u/srcreigh) will also be answering some questions with me tonight, so feel free to direct the, towards him as well! --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] Dude, your hair looks awesome today. [A] That isn’t a question, but I know right?! --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] How can I donate to support you guys? [A] Up until tonight there was actually an option to donate, but I feel that as we move forward, we want to turn this into one of the big players in the SMS space on Android. I can't thank you guys enough for the support that you've shown through donations, but we want this to feel less like a side-project and more like something you expect from someone like Google. That being said, we're never going to stop being involved with the community. We want to build an awesome app with awesome support behind it. If you do want to support us, you can do this by upgrading to QKSMS+! It can be done through the QKSMS+ settings screen, and it'll unlock you over 150 new color schemes as well as an automatic nigh mode. Buying this once is all you need to get every single upcoming premium feature, they'll be bundled in as part of QKSMS+ as they come available. --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] I emailed you a couple nights ago, should I expect a response or what? [A] Of course! I've just been pretty swamped over the last couple nights, and there's over 100 emails waiting in my inbox for me to reply to. I'll be getting back to all of them tonight though, so do not fret! --------------------------------------------------------- [Q] MMS still isn’t working perfectly for me. What’s up with that? [A] MMS is a weird thing on Android. No app does it perfectly for everyone, but we can aim to have it nailed down for as many people as we can. Currently, MMS with QKSMS is working for most of our users. We’ve made HUGE improvements to it over the last couple weeks, and it’s only going to get better. One of the most common issues that we’ve been having is that the app can’t find your APN settings automatically, so they need to be entered in manually in order to be able to send MMS. These settings are typically found in your phone’s system settings, under the Access Point Names. Aside from this, we have plans to drastically improve sending/receiving reliability, notifications, and the attachment flow, including being able to take photos right from the app and send multiple types of attachments. --------------------------------------------------------- Anyways, let me know if you have any questions or feedback, I'd love to hear them! Edit: It's now 3am and I've got work in the morning so I'll call it for tonight. Feel free to continue posting though, I'll get back to all of you after work :)\", 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2mink1/dev_its_official_qksms_has_been_released/', 'created_utc': '2014-11-17 01:41:01', 'subreddit': 'Android'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Coinbase rumors', 'content': \"There are a lot of CB rumors right now involving liquidity and potential bankruptcy. First, I have seen no credible report that indicates CB is about to go bankrupt. CB going bankrupt would be a huge setback for crypto and I have to imagine that if CB was in such serious trouble that they were about to go bankrupt there would be a significant number of wealthy people or groups that would be highly interested in buying enough shares of CB to take control of the company or to buy them out and take the company private again. Second, writing stories about CB maybe going bankrupt is a good way to get your article clicked online so I imagine bloggers and others are writing about what gets clicked. In the past week or two I've heard: &#x200B; 1. CB Pro is shutting down because CB is in trouble. As far as I can tell CB Pro style trading will be available as Advanced Trade on Coinbase. The fee schedule to buy/sell looks about the same, but not sure what it will end up being by the end of the year. Of course Coinbase Pro, had it continued, could have altered trading fees at any time itself. My biggest concern here is what happens to existing orders and what glitches might I experience if I have any trades or cash or crypto on CB Pro at the time it changes over. This change doesn't indicate any upcoming bankruptcy. It would be nice to have everything on one platform instead of having to sometimes move stuff between CB and CB Pro. If Advanced Trade sucks or starts charging crazy fees, then that will be a huge deal. 2. CB layoffs and rescinding job offers. This happens during poor economic times. People get laid off and job offers are rescinded. It isn't a good sign for CB, but this is hardly unique to CB. 3. Hundreds of Millions of $s are leaving CB. People are pulling coins and cash off of exchanges for their own wallets. I think people are realizing it is better to pay gas and transfer fees and in some cases forego staking or lending awards in order to ensure the safety of your crypto. Obviously Celsius and Voyager and others are spurring this on. How much of an impact the removal of crypto from CB will have on CB remains to be seen. CB, allegedly, doesn't make money lending out crypto so they aren't losing out on interest from lending out coins. They also thus allegedly don't have coins at risk that are being lent out. 4. CB allegedly temporarily shutting down the US affiliate marketing program. Not sure the reasons for this other than they maybe have decided it isn't paying off. I'm not really familiar with this program. 5. CB Pro USDC trading pairs recently disappeared. Apparently they are merging USDC with USD. 6. Etc. Despite the fact that I am unaware of any credible report showing Coinbase is about to go bankrupt, I have moved most of my coins off of ALL CEXs, including CB (Obviously I can't move my staked ETH). If CB were to ever go bankrupt, nobody knows for sure if they would ever see their crypto again or how much of a warning there would be (would you have enough time to move your coins?). So, do I trust my coins on CB? No. Is it because I think CB is going bankrupt this month or next? No; it is because I don't trust any CEX and I'd rather keep my own coins in my own wallets. TL;DR---OP hasn't seen any credible report that CB is about to go bankrupt. There are a bunch of bankruptcy rumors that might be based on multiple factors, such as current CB layoffs, CB Pro being phased out, etc. Still, you might want to get your coins off of ALL CEXs to be safe and into your own wallets. OP has moved most of his coins off of all CEXs, including CB.\", 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w1bpt6/coinbase_rumors/', 'created_utc': '2022-07-17 16:49:49', 'subreddit': 'cryptocurrency'}\n",
